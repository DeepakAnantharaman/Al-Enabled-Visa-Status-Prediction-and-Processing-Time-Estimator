Data Collection

Gathered sample/historical visa datasets from public sources and synthetic records.

Integrated email-related metadata and visa status information into a unified dataset.

Data Loading

Imported datasets into Jupyter Notebook for exploration and preprocessing.

Verified schema consistency and ensured smooth data ingestion.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Applied EDA techniques to understand distributions, correlations, and anomalies.

Visualized categorical features (visa type, status, country) and numerical features (processing time).

Identified missing values and inconsistencies in categorical fields.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Missing Values: Imputed or dropped based on feature importance and data integrity.

Categorical Encoding: Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., visa type, applicant country).

Target Label Generation: Created target variable representing processing time in days.
